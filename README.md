# Create rose diagrams in Inkscape from survex .3d files

*May 2020: completely updated for Inkscape 1.0*

Compute a passage orientation rose diagram from a survex `.3d` file
and render as SVG into the current document.

### Installation

Copy the files `rose_create.py` and `rose_create.inx` into your local
Inkscape extension folder: `$HOME/.config/inkscape/extensions/` on
unix, or `%APPDATA%\inkscape\extensions\` on Windows.
There are no dependencies since the extension natively
reads the binary `.3d` file format (v8 only, which is generated by
survex versions from 1.2.7).

### Usage

The extension appears under Extensions &rarr; Render  &rarr;
Rose diagram from .3d file&hellip;

This brings up a small dialog box with options to adjust sizes, set
the number of sectors, choose whether to render the diagram in color
or black and white, and to set a title.  If the title is
left blank, a default title is extracted from the `.3d` file.  Live
preview is available.
